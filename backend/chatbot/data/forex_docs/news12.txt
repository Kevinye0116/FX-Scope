 Geopolitical risks 
 In this week’s edition of IG Macro Intelligence, we examine the rising global geopolitical tensions and the Australian stocks that could be affected. 
 Tensions rising 
 The world, and consequently the global economy, is currently facing a number of geopolitical risks, including the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and threats of another US-China trade war. 
 Geopolitical conflicts can not only cause disastrous humanitarian loss but also pose significant threats to the global economic outlook, affecting economic growth, inflation, financial markets, and supply chains. 
 S&amp;P Global warns that risks posed by current social and political unrest could threaten the world’s energy and food security. 
 Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has flagged a 58% chance that global growth in 2025 will fall below its World Economic Outlook baseline but argues that tail risks remain manageable thanks to supportive financial conditions and healthy credit growth. However, the IMF warns that if geopolitical risks increase and financial conditions tighten, the probability of 2025 growth dropping below their baseline could rise to 75%, akin to the COVID crisis, signalling greater downside risks.

 Safe-haven plays 
 One of the clearest "safe-haven" market winners amid geopolitical unrest has been Gold . 
 Gold prices have risen by 30% this year, driven by strong central bank purchases, safe-haven demand, and Federal Reserve rate cuts. Goldman Sachs Group and UBS recently projected that the rally in bullion would extend into 2025, with both firms predicting the price of the precious metal will reach $3000 an ounce next year.

 Oil prices stabilise amid geopolitical tensions 
 Meanwhile, oil prices have steadied after their largest weekly gain in nearly two months, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East. The conflict in Ukraine, coupled with Iran’s plans to expand nuclear fuel production, has raised concerns about supply disruptions. 
 Bullish sentiment for crude is growing, reflected in Brent’s three-month spread widening to $1.21 a barrel in backwardation last week. Backwardation occurs when the spot, or cash, price of a commodity is higher than the forward, or futures contract, price.

 GrainCorp 
 GrainCorp (ASX:GNC) shares are up 11% year-to-date but have remained flat over the past 12 months. ASX Tradewatch data confirms a downtrend, with the 5-day moving average below both the 20-day and 50-day averages. 
 Robert Spurway, CEO and Managing Director, noted, “That’s well ahead of the timing that we’d expect in previous years, and is reflective of those very strong forecasts from ABS and the good growing conditions in northern Australia. That certainly sets the potential for a strong year ahead. And GrainCorp having that volume creates opportunities not just for GrainCorp but for growers as well.” 
 GrainCorp's FY24 profit slumped by 75% to $62 million, leading to a trimmed special dividend. The latest harvest update reports “excellent” commodity quality, with an intake nearing 8.5 million tonnes. 
 Refinitiv Data indicates an average price target of $9.65, suggesting a 21% upside, with most brokers rating it a 'Buy'. Ord Minnett has issued a “Buy” rating with a $9.80 price target and UBS also maintains a “Buy” rating with a $9.60 price target.
