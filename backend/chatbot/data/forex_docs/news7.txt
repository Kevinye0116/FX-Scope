 Statement on Monetary Policy – November
2024 3. Outlook 
 
 Summary 
 
 The outlook for inflation and the unemployment rate in Australia is
broadly unchanged from the August Statement . The
economy is still assessed to be operating above capacity; however, as the economy
and labour market move towards a better balance between overall supply and
demand, there is more uncertainty around this assessment. 
 Underlying inflation is expected to return to the target range of 2–3 per cent in mid-to-late 2025
and to the midpoint of the target in late 2026. Inflationary
pressures are expected to ease as demand and supply in the economy return to
balance, although the pace of disinflation is expected to be gradual. 
 Headline inflation is expected to temporarily be within the target range
over the coming year, owing primarily to cost-of-living support measures
provided to households. However, year-ended headline inflation is
then expected to increase in the second half of 2025 to be above the target band
when energy rebates are scheduled to end, before moving in line with underlying
inflation once these temporary effects have passed. 
 Labour market conditions remain tight but are expected to return to
balance by late 2025. The unemployment rate is forecast to increase
gradually over the coming year, consistent with subdued economic growth. While
this assessment is little changed from the August Statement , the earlier
easing in some labour market indicators has stalled recently and this presents
some risk that labour market conditions ease by less than expected. Wages growth
is expected to continue slowing gradually alongside an easing in labour market
conditions. 
 GDP growth is expected to return to around its potential growth rate by
late 2025. The recovery in domestic activity over the coming year is
expected to be less pronounced than forecast in the August Statement .
While consumption growth is still expected to pick up alongside rising real
household incomes, recent data suggest that this is likely to occur slightly
later than previously envisaged. 
 The tightening in student visa policy is expected to result in growth in
net overseas migration slowing materially from its current strong
pace. This slowing in population growth is expected to weigh on GDP
growth from mid-2025. However, it will also reduce the economy’s supply
capacity, such that there will not be a material effect on the degree of spare
capacity in the economy and therefore inflation. 
 Forecast growth in major trading partners has been revised slightly
higher for 2025 compared with three months ago, largely due to the
announcement by Chinese authorities of a sizeable stimulus package. 
Otherwise, the outlook for trading partner growth is little changed. Growth in
most G7 economies in 2025 is expected to continue to recover gradually as
household consumption picks up, while growth in the United States is expected to
ease from its current strong rate. Inflation is forecast to continue to ease in
advanced economies, with many central banks now more confident that inflation
will return sustainably to target. 
 There are risks on both sides of the global and domestic
outlook. The outlook internationally remains highly uncertain given
heightened geopolitical risks and potential changes to trade and fiscal policies;
notwithstanding these, the risks to the global outlook are less tilted to the
downside relative to three months ago. Domestically, if low productivity growth
persists over the next couple of years, inflation could take longer to return to
target and GDP growth could also be lower. The timing and pace of the recovery in
private demand could also be later than projected, which would flow through to
labour market and inflation outcomes. 
 
 
 3.1 The global outlook 
 Growth in Australia’s major trading partners has been revised up slightly following the announcement
of stimulus measures by Chinese authorities. 
 Overall GDP growth for Australia’s major trading partners is expected to be moderate, at
close to 3½ per cent in 2025 and 2026 (Graph 3.1). The
outlook has been revised slightly higher relative to three months ago, as upward revisions to growth in
China have been only partially offset by downward revisions to growth in New Zealand and India (for
2026). 
 
 
 
 Graph 3.1 
 
 
 
 GDP growth in China has been revised higher, mainly reflecting recently announced economic policy
support. While full details on the size and composition of further fiscal support are yet
to be announced, our China forecasts assume that around CNY2 trillion (or 1.6 per cent of
GDP) of additional central and local government fiscal support could be provided, alongside measures
announced by the central bank and Chinese regulators. We expect this support will boost consumption and
manufacturing investment and offset a weakening outlook for infrastructure investment. Policy support is
expected to materially impact growth from 2025. Risks to the outlook for growth in China have become more
balanced since the announcement of the stimulus. However, structural headwinds to the economy, such as
ongoing weakness in real estate and local government financial conditions, could still intensify. 
 Growth in most G7 economies is expected to pick up a little in 2025, except for the United
States. GDP growth in G7 economies overall is expected to be supported by stronger real
income growth and easing financial conditions but is forecast to remain below pre-pandemic decade
averages. Following a period of strong growth, US GDP growth is forecast to slow a little further in
coming quarters, before picking up as financial conditions continue to ease; Consensus forecasts for US
growth in 2025 are a little weaker than the latest Federal Reserve forecasts. 
 Many advanced economy central banks are easing policy settings as they have become increasingly
confident that inflation is returning sustainably to targets and with some noting emerging downside
risks. While central banks generally expect only modest increases in unemployment rates
from current levels, many have become more attentive to downside risks to the labour market and
inflation; labour market conditions remain tighter in Australia than in other advanced economies.
Inflation in New Zealand, Canada and Sweden is now assessed to be around target and is expected to remain
there in the forecast period (for Sweden, this abstracts from a temporary drag from energy prices).
Inflation is expected to approach the target next year in the euro area, in 2026 in the United States and
United Kingdom, and in 2027 in Norway. 
 3.2 Key domestic judgements 
 The central forecasts incorporate many judgements, such as the choice of models used and whether to
deviate from the models given the signal from recent data or qualitative information from liaison. These
judgements are considered and debated extensively throughout the forecast process. The three most
important judgements for the staff’s current assessment of the economic outlook are discussed below.
 
 Key judgement #1 – Household consumption growth will recover in line with growth in real incomes,
but a bit later than forecast in the August Statement . 
 The weak consumption outcome in the June quarter and partial data for the September quarter suggest that
momentum in consumption growth has been weaker than expected in the August Statement . The staff
judge that this reflects a combination of underlying weakness and the unwinding of one-off spending in
the March quarter (see Chapter 2: Economic Conditions ). The underlying weakness may reflect a greater
degree of precautionary saving by households than had been assumed, or that it may take more time than
expected for household spending to pick up following the earlier stabilisation of real incomes and recent
tax cuts. Weighing these considerations up, the staff have taken some signal from recent outcomes, with
the level of consumption per capita in the near term revised down from three months ago and the saving
rate revised up. Further out, we continue to judge that the pick-up in real income and wealth will boost
consumption growth, such that by 2026, consumption per capita and the saving rate return towards the
levels expected at the August Statement . 
 Key judgement #2 – The labour market will continue to ease at a gradual pace and then stabilise
following the pick-up in GDP growth. 
 The unemployment rate is forecast to gradually increase over the coming year, consistent with subdued
growth in economic activity and the signal from some leading indicators of labour demand, including
vacancies and hiring intentions. 
 We judge that part of the adjustment to easing labour demand will continue to occur through lower
vacancies (which are still elevated) and average hours worked. While the rate of layoffs has increased,
it remains at a low level relative to history. It is judged that this will likely remain the case while
vacancies remain high, and so the easing in labour demand can be partly absorbed by a decline in
vacancies without a large increase in the unemployment rate. While unemployment could rise sharply if
businesses have been hoarding labour and reach a tipping point, there is little evidence that this has
been occurring on a large scale: survey measures of capacity utilisation remain above average and
vacancies and average hours are at or above their long-run trends. 
 In recent months, some labour market indicators, such as the underemployment rate, suggest that the labour
market could have stopped easing. If labour underutilisation does not increase by as much as anticipated,
this could slow disinflation progress given the assessment that there is currently excess demand in the
labour market. However, staff have judged that there is enough evidence across the full suite of
indicators for further gradual easing in labour market conditions. 
 Key judgement #3 – The unemployment and output gaps will gradually close, bringing inflation back
to target. 
 Estimates of how far the economy is from sustainable full employment or potential output are important
considerations for the wages and inflation outlook, but are subject to considerable uncertainty.
Moreover, as economic conditions have eased and the economy and labour market have moved towards a better
balance, it becomes more difficult to conclude if the economy is operating at above or below capacity.
 
 The current assessment is that there is excess demand in the labour market. However, the gradual increase
in the unemployment rate over the forecast period is judged to see the labour market return to around the
level consistent with full employment in late 2025. In the broader economy, a period of subdued economic
growth has quickly reduced excess demand; however, it is assessed that parts of the economy remain tight.
Further weakness in aggregate demand is expected to bring the economy closer to balance. These outcomes
are based on an assumption that trend labour productivity growth picks up. Risks around this judgement
are discussed in section 3.4 Key risks to the outlook . 
 3.3 The domestic outlook 
 Growth in domestic demand is expected to pick up as growth in household consumption recovers and public
demand continues to support activity. 
 The forecasts are conditioned on a cash rate path derived from financial market pricing; it is assumed
that the cash rate has peaked, with market pricing implying little chance of a further increase. The cash
rate is assumed to begin to decline around mid-2025, and to decline to around 3.5 per cent by
the end of 2026. This is a little higher than the assumption underpinning the forecasts in August. The
pick-up in private demand is driven by an increase in household consumption growth, which is expected to
reach its pre-pandemic decade average in late 2025 (excluding the effect of cost-of-living subsidies, see
below), driven by growth in real incomes as the Stage 3 tax cuts take effect and inflation eases.
 
 The pick-up in private demand is expected to occur a little later than in the August
 Statement , driven by a slower recovery in household consumption. This slower recovery
reflects a reassessment of household consumption and savings momentum following the unexpectedly weak
consumption outcome in the June quarter and partial data for the September quarter. These data suggest
that households will save slightly more of their income in the second half of 2024 than was previously
assumed (Graph 3.2). A lower assumption for resident population growth is expected to weigh a little
on aggregate household consumption growth in 2026. 
 Cost-of-living subsidies will lower measured household consumption growth in the September quarter
of this year before boosting it in 2025. The official statistical treatment of the
cost-of-living subsidies provided to households will have the effect of reallocating measured spending
between household and public consumption. This is expected to reduce measured household consumption
growth in the September quarter of 2024 by around 0.4 percentage points, before adding to household
consumption growth in 2025 as the subsidies unwind (as currently legislated). The impact of this
reallocation was factored into the August Statement forecasts. 
 
 
 
 Graph 3.2 
 
 
 
 The outlook for private investment is broadly similar to the August
 Statement . Business investment is expected to stabilise around current levels over the
year ahead. Information from the RBA’s liaison program and the ABS Capital Expenditure Survey
suggests that firms have moderated their investment intentions for the year ahead in response to
persistent construction cost pressures and delays to renewable energy projects. By contrast, the level of
dwelling investment is expected to be higher than previously expected in the near term, consistent with
the pick-up in building approvals over the past year. The effect of construction cost pressures on
business investment has been slower to materialise than for dwelling investment, consistent with the
shorter lead times for detached housing projects and the sustained period of headwinds to household
incomes. Private investment is expected to pick up from late 2025, supported by the assumed decline in
the cash rate, the large pipeline of infrastructure work, digitisation and the renewable energy
transition. 
 Public spending is expected to continue supporting aggregate economic growth. Growth in
public consumption is expected to remain robust over coming years, supported by the provision of
government services to households, with the outlook similar to three months ago (Graph 3.3). The
near-term outlook for growth in public investment is weaker, with investment expected to stabilise
following the completion of some major projects; information from liaison suggests that some projects
have been deferred. However, this weakness is expected to be temporary given investment spending
announced in government budgets and the large pipeline of engineering work yet to be done. 
 
 
 
 Graph 3.3 
 
 
 
 The outlook for growth in net overseas migration has been revised down, which will reduce growth in both
demand and supply in the economy from mid-2025. 
 In addition to the near-term downward revisions to GDP growth stemming from weaker private demand,
GDP growth has been revised down from mid-2025 in line with slower expected growth in net overseas
migration (Graph 3.4). The lower forecast for net overseas migration
primarily reflects the impact of a range of international education policies, which includes a tightening
in student visa policy; the effects of which has started to become apparent in timely data (see Chapter 2:
Economic Conditions ). This has driven a downwards revision to the outlook for international education
exports from mid-2025. The outlook for other migration has also been revised down and this is expected to
weigh a little on household consumption. Lower population growth also reduces the supply capacity of the
economy given the propensity of migrants to work; this suggests that there will not be a material impact
on the amount of spare capacity in the economy over the medium term. 
 
 
 
 Graph 3.4 
 
 
 
 Demand and supply are expected to move closer to balance over the forecast period. 
 It is assessed that there is still excess demand in parts of the economy, but the economy will
gradually approach balance. The output gap is expected to narrow further, particularly in
the near term alongside subdued growth in aggregate demand, and close by the end of the forecast period,
although there is considerable uncertainty around this projection. The staff’s assumption for
potential output growth reflects a decline in population growth from its current high rate being largely
offset by an increase in trend productivity towards its pre-pandemic decade average. There are large
risks around the outlook for supply capacity, which are explored in section 3.4 Key
risks to the outlook . 
 The labour market is expected to continue to ease over the next year before stabilising at a level
consistent with full employment estimates. This outlook is little changed from the August Statement . 
 Labour underutilisation rates are expected to increase gradually alongside subdued growth in
economic activity. The unemployment rate is forecast to increase further over coming
quarters, consistent with the recent easing in some leading indicators of labour demand, including job
vacancies and employment intentions (Graph 3.5). Supported by the gradual pick-up in GDP growth, the
unemployment rate is expected to stabilise at around 4½ per cent, which is consistent with the
staff’s estimates of full employment. 
 
 
 
 Graph 3.5 
 
 
 
 Growth in employment and the labour force are both expected to ease in the medium term. 
Participation in the labour force, which has been higher than expected in recent months, is now judged to
pick up a little more in the near term, reflecting solid employment opportunities as well as
cost-of-living pressures faced by households. Further out, the participation rate is expected to continue
to increase very gradually, as the continued trend of increased participation by females and older
workers is partially offset by some discouraged workers leaving the labour force as demand conditions
eases. 
 Growth in nominal wages is expected to moderate further as the labour market eases. 
 Wages growth has passed its peak and is expected to slow further as the labour market eases.
 The quarterly pace of wages growth eased a little more than expected in the June quarter, and
points to slightly lower wages growth over the second half of 2024 than previously expected
(Graph 3.6). The 3.75 per cent increase to modern award wages, effective from 1 July,
is a step down in award-linked wages growth compared with the previous year. Further easing in the labour
market is also expected to continue to put downward pressure on wages growth, consistent with information
from liaison that employers expect a further slowing in wages growth in the coming year. The pace of
nominal wages growth is expected to remain high relative to productivity growth outcomes in the near
term, before gradually easing towards the end of the forecast period to a pace that is consistent with
inflation remaining sustainably within the target range. However, the sustainable level of wages growth
in the medium term depends on underlying trend productivity growth, as discussed in section 3.4 Key
risks to the outlook . 
 
 
 
 Graph 3.6 
 
 
 
 Growth in unit labour costs is expected to moderate from its high rate over the coming
years. Growth in nominal unit labour costs (ULCs) – the measure of labour costs most
relevant for firms’ cost of production and so for inflation outcomes – is expected to ease as
nominal wages growth gradually eases (Graph 3.7). Weak productivity outcomes are also expected to
contribute to ULCs growth remaining elevated. Growth in ULCs is expected to remain a little above the
rate consistent with achieving the inflation target until the latter half of 2026. 
 
 
 
 Graph 3.7 
 
 
 
 Labour productivity growth in the second half of 2024 is assumed to be weaker than previously
anticipated; there is significant uncertainty around the longer term outlook. The weaker
near-term outlook reflects the lower forecast for GDP growth but continued solid employment growth. The
strength in healthcare employment has had a small drag on measured aggregate productivity growth in
recent years, and this effect is likely to continue. The productivity outlook further out is little
changed. Productivity growth is assumed to pick up in the medium term to reach its long-term (excluding
the pandemic) average rate (see section 3.2 Key domestic judgements ). The forecasts assume
multifactor productivity growth will rebound over the next couple of years, which would be consistent
with increased rates of technology adoption, improved reallocation of labour between low- and
high-productivity firms, improved labour quality and improved quality of job matching. However, there are
risks to the outlook for productivity that will have implications for inflation outcomes (see section
3.4 Key risks to the outlook ). 
 Underlying inflation has continued to moderate and is expected to ease further. The outlook for
underlying inflation is little changed from the August Statement . 
 Underlying inflation – as measured by trimmed mean inflation – is expected to return
to the target range in mid-to-late 2025 and to the midpoint of the target in late 2026 
(Graph 3.8). The output and unemployment gaps are projected to narrow and close over the forecast
period, and growth in unit labour costs is expected to ease, which would help bring the economy back
towards a balanced position and inflation back to target. Inflation expectations are assumed to remain
consistent with achieving the inflation target over this timeframe. 
 
 
 
 Graph 3.8 
 
 
 
 Year-ended headline inflation is expected to temporarily be within the target range, before rising
again in the second half of next year. Governments’ cost-of-living measures –
electricity rebates and increases to rent assistance – reduced headline inflation in the September
quarter and will also weigh on inflation in the December quarter (Graph 3.9). However, year-ended
headline inflation is expected to increase when the electricity rebates are scheduled to unwind next
year, which would see headline inflation increase sharply to be back above the target range in the second
half of 2025, before converging towards underlying inflation once these temporary factors have passed.
Because headline inflation can be affected by large swings in the prices of individual items, the RBA
continues to pay close attention to underlying measures of inflation. [1] 
 
 
 
 Graph 3.9 
 
 
 
 Services inflation remains high and is expected to decline only gradually over the coming
year. Strong domestic cost pressures (both labour and non-labour inputs) have kept services
inflation outcomes high in recent quarters. The more gradual decline in services inflation relative to
the earlier decline in goods inflation is in line with trends in other advanced economies. However, cost
pressures are expected to ease alongside a softening in labour market conditions, contributing to a
gradual easing in market services inflation over the forecast period. Inflation of administered items
(excluding utilities) is expected to ease a little in the coming year since the prices of some items are
indexed to past headline inflation, which has declined. 
 Housing inflation is expected to moderate from a high level over the forecast period, and to ease
a little more quickly than expected in the August Statement . Tightness in
the rental market is now forecast to unwind a bit more quickly than expected in August, due to increases
in average household size (possibly linked to affordability constraints) and slowing population growth.
Despite the recent sharp slowing in advertised rent inflation, CPI rents inflation is expected to remain
elevated for a time as rents on new leases gradually flow through to the stock of rents in the CPI. New
dwelling cost inflation is expected to moderate as capacity constraints, such as shortages for skilled
trades, gradually abate. However, in some capital cities, particularly Perth, these capacity constraints
are expected to take longer to ease. 
 Goods inflation has eased and is expected to stabilise at a relatively modest pace during the
forecast period. The earlier easing in imported inflation as global supply chains normalised
last year has flowed through to domestic goods prices. Growth in domestic labour and non-labour costs is
moderating, and information from liaison suggests that softer demand conditions have meant that retailers
are less able to pass on increases in costs. While there has been little evidence from liaison that
elevated shipping costs are flowing through to retail prices, there have been some reports of
retailers’ margins being affected by recent shipping cost rises over the past few months. 
 3.4 Key risks to the outlook 
 The risks to the domestic outlook for activity and inflation are broadly balanced. 
 While we view the risks to the outlook overall as balanced, there is always considerable uncertainty about
key judgements and broader conditions. Staff have considered a range of plausible ways in which the
economy could evolve differently to our base case or central forecast, and the likely effects this could
have on our inflation and employment objectives. 
 Key risk #1 – The period of subdued growth in private activity could be more persistent, or the
recovery in private activity could be much stronger. 
 The central forecast is for a gradual recovery in private demand following a period of subdued growth. 
 However, the recent weak consumption data suggests it is possible that consumers are even more cautious
and constrained than the central forecasts assume, and they may choose to save more of their growth in
income. There is also a risk that large investment projects may be delayed even further than we have
assumed if persistent construction cost pressures and weak consumer demand mean that construction
projects do not become more economically feasible. This could prolong the period of below-trend GDP
growth. The staff considered a scenario of weaker consumption and investment growth using the MARTIN
model. GDP growth would be approximately 0.5 and 0.1 percentage points lower over 2025 and
2026, and the increase in the unemployment rate would be more pronounced. This would see a period of
excess supply or spare capacity in the economy, which would imply inflation could reach the midpoint of
the target by mid-2026 (without any change to the cash rate path that underpins the central forecast).
 
 Alternatively, growth in private aggregate demand could rebound more quickly than forecast. Households may
respond more strongly than expected to the near-term pick-up in household incomes if a greater share of
households have become liquidity constrained in recent years than thought, or because households are
willing to save less out of their current income following the significant increases in wealth (including
a large stock of savings) since the onset of the pandemic. Business investment may pick up more quickly
than expected, in part due to improved business sentiment spurred by improving consumer demand. In the
‘higher private activity’ scenario, the unemployment rate would remain below estimates of full
employment over the forecast period. As such, progress in reducing inflation would be slower, with the
scenario showing trimmed mean inflation in the top half of the target range at the end of 2026
(Graph 3.10). 
 
 
 
 Graph 3.10 
 
 
 
 Key risk #2 – Weak productivity growth could slow progress on disinflation. 
 It is possible that we are overestimating the degree of supply capacity in the economy over the next few
years because productivity growth may not return to its long-run average growth rate as currently
assumed. The staff’s assumption for potential output growth assumes that a decline in population
growth from its current high rate will be largely offset by an increase in trend productivity. However,
productivity growth has been weaker than expected in recent years (see Box D: Annual Review of the
Forecasts ). Staff considered two scenarios of weaker multifactor productivity growth:
‘moderate’ multifactor productivity growth assumes the average growth over the five years
before the pandemic, while ‘zero’ multifactor productivity growth is a continuation of recent
outcomes (Graph 3.11). 
 
 
 
 Graph 3.11 
 
 
 
 Lower productivity growth would be inflationary because it is expected to cause a greater reduction in the
supply capacity of the economy than in GDP growth. This is because it would take households, businesses
and governments some time to adjust their saving, spending and investment decisions to the weaker
productivity outlook. In both downside scenarios, GDP growth is moderately weaker by the end of the
forecast period (Graph 3.11). Under the zero productivity assumption, the progress of disinflation
would be expected to slow sharply, and inflation would be at the upper bound of the band by end 2026. 
 Key risk #3 – Global uncertainty creates two-sided risks to the domestic outlook. 
 The global outlook remains highly uncertain given heightened geopolitical risks and potentially large
changes to the global trade and fiscal policy outlook during the forecast period. If such shocks
materialise, they could have significant effects on the outlook for activity and inflation in Australia.
 
 An intensification of regional conflicts could disrupt trade and lead to sustained increases in shipping
costs or commodity prices, while also lowering global growth. This would result in higher inflationary
pressure domestically by further constraining the supply capacity of the economy (e.g. given the supply
chain issues that are already affecting construction activity). 
 There is also uncertainty around the degree of fiscal stimulus in the global economy over the next couple
of years. If the Chinese fiscal stimulus is considerably larger than currently assumed in our central
forecast, this will boost domestic growth (and inflation) through trade and commodity linkages (see
 Box B: Economic Policy Developments in China ). In such a scenario, domestic activity would be
boosted by higher exports and export prices, although there would be little upside to the volume of
resource exports unless mining capacity was expanded. Ultimately, the size of the boost to the domestic
economy from a large Chinese stimulus package would depend on both the response of the exchange rate
(which would typically appreciate) as well as how governments respond to any unexpected commodity price
revenue.

 (a) Forecasts finalised on 30 October. (b) Forecasts are rounded to the first
decimal point. Shading indicates historical data. (c) The cash rate is assumed to
move in line with expectations derived from financial market pricing. Prior to the
May Statement, the cash rate assumption also reflected information derived from
surveys of professional economists. For more information, see
 A Change to the Cash
Rate Assumption Method for the Forecasts . (d) The daily exchange rate (TWI) is
assumed to be unchanged at its current level going forward. (e) Oil prices are
assumed to remain constant at the current price over the current quarter. For the
rest of the forecast period oil prices are expected to remain around the price
implied by the six-month-forward rate. (f) The population assumption draws on a
range of sources, including partial indicators from the Australian Bureau of
Statistics, migration policies, and estimates made by the Australian Government. 
(g) GDP per hour worked (non-farm). (h) Household savings ratio refers to the
ratio of household saving (disposable income minus consumption) to household
disposable income, net of depreciation. (i) Real Wage Price Index and non-farm
average earnings per hour worked are both deflated by Consumer Price Index.
